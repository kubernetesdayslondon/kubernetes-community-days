title: Diversity Scholarship
---

The Kubernetes Community Days London 2020 diversity scholarship program provides support to those from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in the UK technology and/or open source communities (especially including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQIA+, women, racial minorities, and persons with disabilities) who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend this event for financial reasons.

A number of scholarships will be provided and recipients will receive up to £150 to reimburse standard travel expenses within the UK. Recipients will also receive up to two nights accommodations if travel takes over two hours, and complimentary conference registration to both days of the Kubernetes Community Days London 2020. 

Please note that you will be responsible for arranging and paying for your travel directly. You will then be reimbursed up to the maximum stipend amount of £150 after the event. The stipend may only be used for standard fare travel within the UK.

Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Selection will be made by an assembled group of reviewers who will assess each applicant’s request. Decisions will be made by August 3rd. All application information will be kept confidential.
